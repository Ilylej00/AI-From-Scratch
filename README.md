# AI From Scratch

This project was entirely inspired by (and borrowed from) Mark Kraay. As part of my final presentation for my Philosophy of AI course in college, I wanted to see how much of a simple AI I could write with no background in AI, and for what I could not figure out I carefully read through the code provided by Mark in order to discover what was going on under the hood.

I was able to fully replace the linear algebra code, but struggled greatly to replace the Neural Net logic -- specifically the back propagation.

This project gave me a much better understanding about what an Deep Learning Neural Net was actually doing in order to achieve the behaviour we expect.
